## 🧠 About Me

I'm a self-taught Web Alchemist who builds aesthetic and functional web experiences with a side of creativity.  
Currently grinding full-stack dev, while also editing videos, designing cool sh*t, and occasionally yapping my thoughts into the void.  

Always leveling up. Always vibing.  
Just a curious mind making things that *look good* and *feel better*.
